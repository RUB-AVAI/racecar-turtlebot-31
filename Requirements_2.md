# Must Have
    - Basics:
        - ensuring that basic movement commands can be executed
        - integrate the necessary sensors with the Turtlebot for usage
        - efficient computation (classification/detection of environment)
    - Localization: 
        - map its environment for improved navigation and awareness (SLAM)
        - Odometry 
        - 
    - Perception:
        - differentiate between cones
        - detect path and detect "wrong" cones (e.g. cones on different path)
        -
    - Planning
        - process sensor data and plan ahead
        - react appropriately as soon as it is in danger of damaging itself or other things

# Should Have
    - autonomously detect and avoid obstacles in its path
    - 

# Could Have
    - monitor the Turtlebot’s status and current operation through a user interface (dashboard)
    - Tokyo Drift Mode

# Won't Have



Localization
                -> Planning
Perception          * -          Control

Perception: - YOLO
            - Lidar merge with cones and pictures

Localization:
